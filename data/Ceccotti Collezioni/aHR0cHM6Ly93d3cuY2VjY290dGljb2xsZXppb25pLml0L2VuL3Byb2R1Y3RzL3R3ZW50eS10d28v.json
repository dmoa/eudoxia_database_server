With its solid American walnut or maple frame, it is inspired by the rounded lines of the early 20th century, recalling the Liberty style. The name refers to the 22 wooden elements of which the armchair is composed, fixed together in a process that takes eight hours for the gluing and 72 hours of drying. It represents an excellent example of the design complexity that is possible thanks to the techniques, artisan ability and attention to the quality of materials that form part of the Ceccotti Collezioni DNA. The seat and the backrest, which are padded and can be upholstered in fabric, leather or natural leather, together with the under-seat tray, also in leather, guarantee maximum comfort.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MINIATURA_twentytwo-600x450.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
