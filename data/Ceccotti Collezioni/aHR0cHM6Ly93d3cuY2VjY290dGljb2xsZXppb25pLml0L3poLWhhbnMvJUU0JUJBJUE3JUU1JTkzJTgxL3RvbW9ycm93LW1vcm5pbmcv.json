It features an extravagantly high headboard wider than the bed frame, designed for a comfortable reading experience with its upper part gently leaning backward for pillow placement. This bed showcases elegantly carved wooden crossbars separating the two sections and includes three padded areas in the lower half. Supported by four slender legs, the substantial volume of the bed still maintains a light appearance. The design also features a raised solid wood base, padded frames around, and beech slats, serving as an alternative to the classic plywood base. The padded components can be covered in fabric or leather.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Tomorrow-Morning_letto_alone-header.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
