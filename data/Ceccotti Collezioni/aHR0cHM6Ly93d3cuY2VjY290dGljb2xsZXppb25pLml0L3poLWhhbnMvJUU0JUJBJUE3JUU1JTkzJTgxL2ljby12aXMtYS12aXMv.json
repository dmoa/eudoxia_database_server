The sofa has a structure in solid American walnut and is characterized by an \"S\"-shaped upholstered backrest which entirely envelops the figure of the occupant before extending to become an armrest. Thanks to its informal and extremely comfortable seat, Ico Vis a Vis offers an ideal solution for public spaces such as hotel lobbies, lounge areas and boutiques.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ico-vis-a-vis_01-600x450.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
