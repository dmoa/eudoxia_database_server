{"name": "Arturo | Small desk - Ceccotti Collezioni", "price": "None", "currency": "None", "width": "None", "height": "None", "depth": "None", "dimension_unit": "None", "description": "Now a feature of the most intimate spaces and a symbol of the smart living room, the small desk today has been transformed from antique furniture into an object of design experimentation, capable of combining different functions, from work to entertainment. Arturo, designed by Christophe Pillet, is unique for its minimal design. Conceived in 2013 with very small dimensions, it seems to be designed for the new dynamics of domestic living. Made of solid American walnut and veneered plywood, it has a round section that characterizes the legs and crosspieces. A stylistic solution also evident on the top frame, which can be covered in wood or leather.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Arturo_scrittoio_alone-header-1.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
