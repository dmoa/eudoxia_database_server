Born from the creativity of Roberto Lazzeroni in 2014, the Neverfull line (which includes also sideboards) is a reinterpretation of classic furniture. Made of solid American walnut and veneered plywood, it has doors and sides upholstered with solid walnut strips that are applied alongside each other by hand. This gives a strong visual impact which is accentuated by the dualism of materials: American walnut on the outside, light maple on the inside. The top is made from wood, but it is also available in marble, with 7 different types to choose from.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/56778NEVER_high_mid_03-300x225.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
