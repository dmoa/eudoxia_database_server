The inspiration for this table comes from this design complexity that brings to mind the Far East. It was on the basis of this concept that No√® Duchaufour-Lawrence designed Obi in 2007. Its most distinctive feature is the central base which, like a cross-shaped wooden sash, ties together the parts and supports the top. The table comes in various sizes and two different shapes: square and rectangular. The surface can come in American walnut, like the frame, or visarm glass in three different finishes: transparent, burnished or smoked.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Obi_alone-header.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
