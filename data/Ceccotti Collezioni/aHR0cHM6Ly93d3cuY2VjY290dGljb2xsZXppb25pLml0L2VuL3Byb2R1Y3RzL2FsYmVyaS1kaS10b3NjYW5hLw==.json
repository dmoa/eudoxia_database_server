The tray - made of ash wood - features a lip around the edge and four feet that elevate it above the surface below, making its structure leaner and more elegant. On the slightly recessed surface, a tapered mushroom-shaped pillar holds the LED lampshade crafted of Volterra alabaster, a highly valued mineral identifiable by its bright white colour. The lampshade - which emits a warm, pleasant light - is available in a number of configurations which recall that iconic foliage of some typical Tuscan trees: the olive, cypress and the maritime pine.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Alberi-di-Toscana_07-scaled.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
