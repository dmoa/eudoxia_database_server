This stands for \"double rêve du printemps\" – double dream of spring – the title of a painting by De Chirico, which designer Roberto Lazzeroni found powerfully evocative. This small sofa seems to fuse the surreal images of Salvador Dalì with the leaping forms of Art Nouveau, imaginatively reworked by the designer in 1989 in a contemporary key. The idea was to create a comfortable piece of furniture with only minimal padding. The cutaway design slants dramatically, with fluid forms that seem almost to float, as if they are held together only by the tray of silver-finished sandblasted glass at the centre. The design and techniques used to produce the base of the sofa are highly complex. D.R.D.P. is reminiscent of the organic silhouette of a plant and of sculptural forms, and it is supported by a series of slim, minimalist legs in solid American walnut. The overall effect is one of extreme lightness, and it is evident that the Hypnos armchair inspired this design.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MINIATURA_D.R.D.P.-600x450.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
