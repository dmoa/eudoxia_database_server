It consists of vertical modules joined together horizontally. Columns resting on the floor alternate with other floating modules to form a checkerboard of different-size spaces in which to place your books and most prized possessions. A solution that not only creates unusual compositions but also communicates lightness, adding an original rhythm to the space. Self-supporting and two-sided, it is made from veneered plywood and a blend of woods in which American walnut alternates with wenge and maple, finished by hand with natural wax.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Skyline_libreria_alone-header.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
