A design icon that highlights excellence in craftsmanship and production expertise, it reinterprets the paradigm of the container, adding charm to any setting. Available in two sizes, constructed from 10 mm brass rods, welded and brushed entirely by hand. It stands as a 'domestic sculpture' to be showcased centrally in any room while remaining functional.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/31899Golden_cage__01-300x225.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
