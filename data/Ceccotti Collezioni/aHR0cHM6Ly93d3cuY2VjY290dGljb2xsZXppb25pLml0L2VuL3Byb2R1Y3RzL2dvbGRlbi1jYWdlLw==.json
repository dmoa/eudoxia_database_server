With its solid curvilinear forms and brass finish, the bookcase is inspired by the glorious 1920s, recalling the mood of the early 20th century. A design icon that underlines the company's consummate artisanship and production expertise. A contemporary classic that reinterprets the concept of the bookcase, exuding its charm in every setting. Available in two different sizes, it is made from 10 mm brass rods, welded and brushed completely by hand. Almost a \"domestic sculpture\", to display at the centre of the room. At the same time it is also functional. In fact, as its name suggests, Golden Cage is designed to safeguard our most valuable possessions.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/31899Golden_cage__01-300x225.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
