The cleverly named piece reflects its ability to store a variety of items over time. This sideboard features intricate design elements reminiscent of traditional sideboards with extensions that simulate the appearance of an open cabinet top. The graceful curves ensure smooth integration with other furniture pieces, and it is crafted from North American walnut wood with an interior of maple. It offers four or five glass or wooden doors and two or three drawers, including one equipped with a utensil tray.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Everything-forever_credenza_alone-header.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
