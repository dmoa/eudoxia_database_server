With its linear style and elegant proportions, its backrest and armrests more slender than the Don Giovanni, Giò guarantees maximum comfort thanks to its large cushioned seat with \"light\" capitonné tufting. The three different sizes available and the upholstery in fabric, leather or natural leather cater for various different tastes. The sofas can be combined with other elements from the same family: Giò Day Bed and Giò Bench.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/86660gio_sofas_01-300x225.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
