Inspired by the organic connection of tables with natural forms, akin to 'raised grounds', his philosophy directs the crafting of this table, integrating natural wood traits with intricate, complex shapes. Available in rectangular or square frames made from solid North American walnut or ash wood, this table supports various top options like 8 mm thick visarm glass, marble, or walnut and ash wood veneered poplar plywood.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Evenmore_10-600x450.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
