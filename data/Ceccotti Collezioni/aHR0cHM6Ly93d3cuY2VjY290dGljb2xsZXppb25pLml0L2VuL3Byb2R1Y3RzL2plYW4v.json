The low table consists of two concentric tops enclosed by an oval wood surround: the lower ring is supported by 3 feet which meld with the edging in a gentle transition, while the upper ring rises above the other supported by two sole elements. The frame is in American walnut or ash with a double top in glass, or in marble for the lower top only.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Jean_01-600x450.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
