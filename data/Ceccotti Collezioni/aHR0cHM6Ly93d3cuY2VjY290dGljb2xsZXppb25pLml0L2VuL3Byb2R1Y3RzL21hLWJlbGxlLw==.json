Ma Belle, designed by Roberto Lazzeroni in 1994, is the perfect example of how the craft of woodworking can be transposed to an industrial dimension. This chair has an organic shape and an extremely lightweight feel, conveyed by a series of sinuous lines that come together in an interplay of large empty spaces.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/05_Ma-Belle-600x450.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
