The structure, crafted from solid American walnut, features thin sections conveying lightness. Each detail showcases meticulous craftsmanship, ensuring high-quality furniture. The chair is distinguished by its curvilinear backrest made from a single, substantial piece of solid wood, and a seat constructed from curved multi-layered poplar veneered on top in walnut. The seat is flush with the frame and padded on top for comfort, available in fabric, leather, or natural leather.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PJs_45-600x450.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
