The frames in solid American walnut support the circular upholstered seat and the slim elongated backrest covered in fabric or leather in a choice of colours from the available palette. Iconest, with its original shell-like shape, offers a refuge in which to enjoy a moment's relaxation in public or private spaces.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Iconest_01-600x450.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
