With its seven drawers in seven different sizes, it is one of the designer's cult pieces. It is entirely made from solid American walnut with four elegant finishes to choose from. Originally created as a piece of daytime furniture for the dining room, it has evolved to become a drawer unit for the bedroom. Its oval shape is innovative and unique for the time in which it was created, considering that it was designed to sit alongside a table. Lazzeroni designed it taking inspiration from a Japanese work of architecture and the perfect ellipse of a tower from which Bandeja borrows its form. This piece is characterised by a truly remarkable sophistication in its execution: the horizontal grooves become handles while also providing an architectural touch by mimicking the various floors of a building. The legs are slim and short compared to the body of the chest of drawers, creating an almost surreal effect that recalls the forms of Salvador Dal√¨.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1546BANDEJA_01.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
