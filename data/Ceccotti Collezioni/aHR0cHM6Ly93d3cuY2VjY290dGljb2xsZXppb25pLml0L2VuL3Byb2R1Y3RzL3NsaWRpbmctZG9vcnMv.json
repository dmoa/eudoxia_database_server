In 2007 Massimo Castagna gave it a contemporary makeover. Sliding takes its name from the two large flush-fitting sliding doors on the front. It stands out for its compact design and is supported by two feet in black nickel finished steel. However, inside it reveals its large storage capacity with functional pull-out trays for the optimum organization of personal belongings. Available in two sizes, it is made from 'warm' solid American walnut and veneered plywood. With four refined finishes to choose from, it is an elegant addition to any space.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Sliding_credenza_alone-header.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
