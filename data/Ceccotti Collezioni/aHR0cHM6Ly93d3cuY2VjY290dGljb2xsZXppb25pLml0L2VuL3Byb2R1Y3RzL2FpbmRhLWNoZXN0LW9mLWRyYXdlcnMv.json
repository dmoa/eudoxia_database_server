It was designed by Roberto Lazzeroni in 2004 and is made of solid American walnut, with an elegant style that is in keeping with the brand as a whole. Characterised by sinuous lines, it features perfect ovals thanks to precise manufacturing techniques. The legs on which it rests lend the overall form a feeling of lightness. For a complete set, it can be accompanied by the Ainda bedside table.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/86710AINDA_01.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
