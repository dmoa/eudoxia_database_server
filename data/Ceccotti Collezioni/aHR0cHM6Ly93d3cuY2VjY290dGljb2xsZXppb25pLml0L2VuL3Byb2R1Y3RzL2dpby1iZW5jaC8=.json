It was designed by Giuseppe Casarosa in 2017 to expand the Ceccotti Collezioni living room range. Aesthetically pleasing, it offers more versatility than the traditional bench. With its plywood frame and American walnut base, as well as its comfortable padded seat that lightens the design it also has a flip-up top in American walnut. Once opened, the top reveals two practical storage compartments. The ebony handle and brass feet exemplify the attention to detail of Ceccotti Collezioni. The benches can be combined with the other products in the family, Giò Sofas or the Giò Day Bed, but can also stand alone, retaining their own independence.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10_Gio-bench-600x450.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
