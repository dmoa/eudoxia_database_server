An essential and geometric structure entirely made from solid American walnut or ash wood. The straight-cut stiles widen at the top to contain the flush padded backrest. A wider front base gives it a unique trapezoid shape. The padded backrest is composed of a poplar plywood frame that, combined with elastic belts, ensures maximum comfort.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ala_01-600x450.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
