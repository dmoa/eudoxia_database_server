A masterpiece of modularity that allows maximum freedom of configuration for adapting to spaces. The structure is made of solid American walnut, available in various colours, while the shelves are available in transparent, smoked or bronzed glass. The various Young Holden modules are held together by connection sides, which elegantly hide this function thanks to the insertion of vertical glass elements which serve as bookends.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Young-holden_libreria_alone-header.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
