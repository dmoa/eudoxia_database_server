Large Flower is a circular sofa with an extremely sophisticated design that can be positioned in the centre of a room or in the hall of a large hotel. A distinctive feature of this piece is the fact that it does not have an upholstered backrest. In fact, at the centre of the circular seat is a stand made from solid American walnut that holds a double vase of clear blown glass. The internal vase is supported by a structure made from burnished brass, which in turn rests on the external vase. The design is a throwback to the age and style of the 1800s, reimagined in a contemporary key: Lazzeroni's modus operandi calls for a transversal design approach that is inspired by a remote or near past and that echoes a wide range of influences. The details are rendered with great precision: the legs recall an animal's paws, while the burnished brass leg tips hint at anthropomorphic forms.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MINIATURA_large-flower-600x450.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
