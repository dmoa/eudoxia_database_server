The headboard, curved as if to embrace the bed, is very high and padded. It is enclosed by two side fascias that support it and give it its characteristic appearance. The elongated legs that the bed rests on raise the whole piece of furniture, while the footboard is upholstered with fabric or leather for even more sumptuous comfort. Minimising the wood elements allows the upholstery to shine, a solution that enhances the monumental impact of the design.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Sleeping-Muse_imm_SX-1.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
