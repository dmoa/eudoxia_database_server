The armchair forms part of an extensive system of armchairs and sofas designed by Vincenzo de Cotiis in 2007, also including the DC 100/85/150 and the DC 280/220. Made from solid wood and curved plywood, padded with variable density non-deformable polyurethane foam, it caters for various comfort requirements thanks to its enveloping frame. The wide range of non-removable covers - including fabrics, leathers and natural leathers - have visible stitching that defines their edges, underlining the modern design of the armchair. DC 60 is the pouf that goes perfectly with the seat.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DC-80-60-_COPERTINA-600x450.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
