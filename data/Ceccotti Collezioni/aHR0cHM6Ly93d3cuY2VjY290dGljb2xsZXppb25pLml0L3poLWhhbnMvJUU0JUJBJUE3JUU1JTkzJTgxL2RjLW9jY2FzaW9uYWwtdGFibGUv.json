The DC Occasional table is one such exemplary work, created by Vincenzo De Cotiis in 2010. This piece, supporting a polished brass base, is available in two sizes. The tabletop frame is made of solid North American walnut wood, with options for a wooden surface, polished brass, or 6mm thick glass in clear, polished, or smoked finishes. With its clean and curvy lines, it highlights the outstanding quality of the materials. The DC Occasional table can be placed alone or combined cleverly, adding a touch of ingenuity to living rooms and injecting vitality into spaces.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/64504DC_occasional_table__01-300x225.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
