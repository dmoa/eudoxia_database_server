Chambre Close is a unique take on the idea of a valet stand, which turns into a versatile and comfortable furniture piece. It is perfect for the bedroom or wardrobe. This is an extremely lightweight chair that weighs less than 3 kilos. Chambre Close is made from solid American walnut wood and has an essential structure inspired by Japanese ideograms. It features a number of sleek minimalist sections that slot together to form a backrest composed of a jacket hanger, a pants hanger and two unique lateral hooks for belts and ties. For added comfort, the seat may be padded and upholstered in a variety of materials, such as fabric, leather or natural leather. In addition there is the shellac finish, which makes the wood glossy and highlights its veining, giving life to unique tactile effects.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/05_Chambre-Close-600x450.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
