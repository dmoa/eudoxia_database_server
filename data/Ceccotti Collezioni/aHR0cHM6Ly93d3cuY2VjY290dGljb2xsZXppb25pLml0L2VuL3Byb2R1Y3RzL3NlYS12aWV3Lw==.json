Designed by Roberto Lazzeroni in 2001, it was inspired by the rigour and minimalism of Scandinavian design. Although it offers a contemporary alternative to traditional upholstered pieces, it does not compromise on comfort: made of solid American walnut, it has a generous seat and a backrest in upholstered plywood. The tips of its legs are made of satin nickel brass. The upholstery is available in fabric, leather or natural leather, offering a wide range of options for customisation.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MINIATURA_sea-view-600x450.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
