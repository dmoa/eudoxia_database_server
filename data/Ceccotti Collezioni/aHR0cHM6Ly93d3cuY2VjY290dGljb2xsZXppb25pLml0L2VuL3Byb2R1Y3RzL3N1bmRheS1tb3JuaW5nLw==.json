The first version rethinks the boundaries between materials, mixing solid American walnut wood with Corian® (in cameo White), with which the designer has designed an open compartment with a rounded shape. Other versions have been added with smooth top in white Corian or in wood. The entire piece is enriched by the retractable drawer with an American walnut frame that surrounds the organizer. Thanks to the versatility and malleability of this material, Noè Duchaufour-Lawrence has created different spaces for storing documents, pencils and stationery accessories. With its light volume, soft lines with rounded corners, and tapered legs in solid walnut, Sunday Morning immediately declares its personality and the mastery of the wood turning, which allows variation between curves and edges.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/35768Sunday_Morning_01-300x225.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
