This iconic piece from Ceccotti Collezioni melds the surreal designs of Salvador Dalí with the fluid forms of Art Noveau, reinterpreted through Lazzeroni's contemporary lens in 1989. Designed to be minimal yet comfortable, its inclined structure and seamless organic shapes appear almost floating, anchored only by a sand-blasted glass table with a silver finish.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/D.R.D.P_alone-header.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
