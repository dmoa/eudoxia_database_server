Symbolizing these tranquil gardens, the coffee table seamlessly integrates North American walnut with a sleek black nickel-finished metal frame, embodying these elements in its structure and design. The tabletop is made from thickened 15mm ultra-transparent tempered glass, available in rectangular shapes in two sizes. Through its design, Niwa invites an interplay between human spaces and the natural world.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/77043Niwa__01-300x225.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
