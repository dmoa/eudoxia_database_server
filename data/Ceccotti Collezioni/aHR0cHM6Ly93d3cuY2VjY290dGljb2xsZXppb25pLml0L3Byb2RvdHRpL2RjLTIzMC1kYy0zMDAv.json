The furniture features a continuous shell and a seat that almost invites relaxation, supported on a solid wood base. The back of the seat, in curved plywood, is covered in natural leather, available in dark brown or black. To further personalize the style, besides choosing from two available sizes, DC 230/300 can be customized in fabric, leather, or natural leather. To complete a living area, it can be paired with the DC 145 armchair from the same family.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30356DC_300__01-300x225.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
