A product that stands out for its rhythmic design. The rigorous geometries of the solid wood profiles alternate with the fluid lines of the base, further accentuated by the slightly inclined surfaces of the doors. This design solution gave its name to the product and made it possible to integrate the handles in the frames and bring the front of the credenza into line with the edge. Oblique represents one of the best examples of Ceccotti Collezioni savoir faire and style. Available in various finishes including American walnut, rosewood, ebony, leather, or matt lacquer.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Oblique-2A_-01-600x450.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
