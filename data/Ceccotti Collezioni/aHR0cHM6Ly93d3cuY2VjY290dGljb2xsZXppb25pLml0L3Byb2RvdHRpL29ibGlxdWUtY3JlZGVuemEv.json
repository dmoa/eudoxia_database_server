{"name": "Oblique | Credenza - Ceccotti Collezioni", "price": "None", "currency": "None", "width": "None", "height": "None", "depth": "None", "dimension_unit": "None", "description": "Designed by DRAW Studio in 2020, the Oblique credenza stands out for its rhythm in design. The strict geometries of the solid wood profiles alternate with the fluid lines of the base, further emphasized by the slightly inclined door planes. This design approach not only names the piece but also integrates handles into the frames, aligning the front of the cabinet with the edge. Offered in variations of four doors or two doors with three central drawers, it increases storage with a glass shelf for each compartment. The base and structure are made from American walnut. Doors, sides, and drawer fronts can be in walnut, rosewood, ebony, leather, or matte lacquer. The top is available in wood, colored glass, or marble, alongside accessories like LED lights, extra shelves, and drawer dividers. The cabinet bottom can be lined with fabric, and drawer bottoms in fabric or leather, showcasing Ceccotti Collezioni's craftsmanship and style.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Oblique_credenza_alone-header.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
