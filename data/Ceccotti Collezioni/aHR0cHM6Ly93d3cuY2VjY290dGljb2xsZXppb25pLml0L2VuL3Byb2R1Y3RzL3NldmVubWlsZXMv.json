Lazzeroni reinterprets the philosophy of the architect Ico Parisi for a modern context: design as part of a union with art and architecture. The result is a table of stunning elegance and an impressive size â€“ up to 350 cm in length. It is made of solid American walnut or ash, with a glass or wood top. The base that supports the tabletop is reminiscent of bridge-like structures in architecture and organic design. Indeed, the table's name, Sevenmiles, calls to mind the bridge of the same name, seven miles in length, in Florida, USA. Sevenmiles is available in a round version or a rectangular version in two sizes. In the smaller option, the table base consists of four legs, while the bigger option has six supporting legs, accentuating the architectural reference.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5861Sevenmiles_04-300x225.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
