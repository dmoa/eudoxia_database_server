Part of the same line as the DC 90 armchair, it shares the same design philosophy and style. With its strong architectural presence, it populates the living room, creating a true island of comfort. The structure, made of solid American walnut, has a slightly curved X shape, elegantly enveloping the deep seats with a backrest featuring two or four/five cushions.", "image_url": "https://www.ceccotticollezioni.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/46646DC225__01-300x225.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
