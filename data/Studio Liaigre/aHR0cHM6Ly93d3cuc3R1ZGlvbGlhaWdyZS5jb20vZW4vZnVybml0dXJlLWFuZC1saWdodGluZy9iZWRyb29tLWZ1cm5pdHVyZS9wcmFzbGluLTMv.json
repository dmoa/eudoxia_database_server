{"name": "Side Table Praslin", "price": "None", "currency": "None", "width": "40", "height": "51", "depth": "None", "dimension_unit": "cm", "description": "Developed in marble for a London interior project, the Praslin expands our offer of side tables in stone. As in its original version, this side table features two textures, with its marble top that seems to balance on the black patina metal base. The unique veining of the top contrasts even more with the metal base. Compact and lightweight, it easily fits in a living room as a sofa end, or in a humid environment such as a bathroom or spa.", "image_url": "https://www.studioliaigre.com/content/uploads/2019/06/praslin-3.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
