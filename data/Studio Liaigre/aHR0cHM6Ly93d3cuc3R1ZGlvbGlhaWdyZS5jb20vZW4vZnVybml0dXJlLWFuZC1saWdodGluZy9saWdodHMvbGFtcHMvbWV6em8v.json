{"name": "Mezzo Lamp", "price": "None", "currency": "None", "width": "25.5", "height": "37.5", "depth": "18.5", "dimension_unit": "cm", "description": "The Mezzo lamp was conceived to respond to a desire for nomadic and easy-to-live-with objects that can be moved from one room to another, and to go outside on a terrace, garden table, or yacht deck. The Mezzo reflects the Liaigre concept of a lifestyle that is casual and does not succumb to a desire for only beauty. Unlike many nomadic objects, often made of ordinary materials, the Mezzo meets quality and durability requirements that are expressed through each of our designs. The Mezzo is made of magnificent, sculpted, patinated bronze and an opal glass reflector blown by a master glassmaker. The result is exceptional. It can be battery operated or wired, offering many possibilities.", "image_url": "https://www.studioliaigre.com/content/uploads/2023/01/mezzo.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
