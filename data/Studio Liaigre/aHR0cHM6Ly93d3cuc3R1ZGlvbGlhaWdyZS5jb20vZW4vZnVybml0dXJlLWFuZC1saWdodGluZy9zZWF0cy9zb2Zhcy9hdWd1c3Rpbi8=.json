With its generous dimensions, wide arms and its seat close to the ground, encouraging guests to settle in comfortably, Liaigre emphasizes with this sofa, the accent on minimalist and relaxed living spaces. In order to create visual depth, the back row of cushions are presented with a slightly different fabric from the front cushions.", "image_url": "https://www.studioliaigre.com/content/uploads/2017/06/augustin.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
