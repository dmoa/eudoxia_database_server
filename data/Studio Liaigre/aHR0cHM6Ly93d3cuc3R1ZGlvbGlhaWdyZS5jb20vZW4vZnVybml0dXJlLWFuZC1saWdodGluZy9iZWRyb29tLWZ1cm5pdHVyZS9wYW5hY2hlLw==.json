Combining an oak base covered with a Magma-colored lacquer with mineral finishes, with a glossy lacquer top made in a new color palette: Azur, Kaolin, Ginger and Porto, they are available together or individually. Imagined by Studio Liaigre for the Interior Design of a private apartment in the heart of the Peninsula hotel in Shanghai, they are part of a family of auxiliary furniture: ends of sofas, stools, small pedestal tables, designed to adapt to everyday life and to any room in the house from the living room, office or bedroom. A nod to Memphis's transalpine designs from the early 1980s, the graphic lines and bold colors of the Panache side tables bring a touch of lightness and sparkle to your interior.", "image_url": "https://www.studioliaigre.com/content/uploads/2022/01/panache-.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
