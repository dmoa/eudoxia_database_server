Thought out in generous proportions, Octave is designed to support the different uses of a contemporary art of living. Its wenge handles give it a strong personality, balanced by lines softened by subtle details.", "image_url": "https://www.studioliaigre.com/content/uploads/2022/01/octave.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
