It was created for an apartment in Knokke, Belgium, set in the midst of nature, between a natural reserve and the sea. The elegant armchair made of hammered patinated bronze, evokes sculptural furniture. The structure is raw and tactile, combining refined saddle work. Its assertive design and clean lines help it to find its place anywhere in the home. It can be sophisticated, classic or minimalist, depending on the surroundings.", "image_url": "https://www.studioliaigre.com/content/uploads/2017/06/Saint-germain--e1677852071279-800x800.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
