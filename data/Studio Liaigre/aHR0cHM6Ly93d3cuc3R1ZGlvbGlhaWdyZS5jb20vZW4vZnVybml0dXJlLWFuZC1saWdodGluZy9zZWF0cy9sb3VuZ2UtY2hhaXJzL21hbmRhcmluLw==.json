It also breaks with the French tradition by introducing a certain informality whilst being part of the refined Asian universe, where each piece is in harmony with the environment. The subtle work of the materials enhances discretion and depth.", "image_url": "https://www.studioliaigre.com/content/uploads/2017/06/Mandarin.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
