{"name": "Coffee Table Riva", "price": "None", "currency": "None", "width": "160", "height": "38", "depth": "40", "dimension_unit": "cm", "description": "Originally created as part of the 'Mythic Malibu' interior design project, the Riva table embodies the natural, uncluttered Californian style of space, light and nature. Designed in collaboration with the architect Richard Meir, this home facing the Pacific Ocean was conceived as a direct extension of the beach. The immaculate white of the exterior and interior architecture invites natural furniture in soft tones. The Riva coffee table has a long, rectangular shape, which makes it particularly suitable for modulating and furnishing an interior space. With its natural color and black veins, the grain of the frak√© wood that covers it contributes to the dynamics of its silhouette. It is made of intertwining wooden pieces, assembled together in a constructive spirit that contrasts with the preciousness of the material. Its simple geometry emphasizes the excellence and sophistication of the woodwork performed on this piece of furniture. Special feature: the Riva coffee table can be placed alone or in pairs.", "image_url": "https://www.studioliaigre.com/content/uploads/2017/06/riva.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
