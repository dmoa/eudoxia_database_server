The warm tones of the door are framed by the black sycamore case, in an elegant satin finish. Small details like the square brushed brass handles and the inlaid brushed brass detail on the doors add to the sophistication of the cabinet. The striking art deco-inspired feet have been finished in high gloss back lacquer, which adds character to the piece. Internally, the Hudson sideboard is finished in satin sycamore black and features two adjustable shelves.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Hudson_Sideboard_StrawMarquetry_SycamoreBlack_DAVIDSONLondon-2.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 12}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 11}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 6}]}
