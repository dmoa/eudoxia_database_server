Finished in any of DAVIDSONs lustrous finishes, the highlight of this cabinet is the eye-drawing radial pattern to the doors and the opulent polished nickel handles that have a shagreen inlay. The cabinet looks particularly wonderful finished in two different timbers that compliment each other beautifully on the eye. The doors open on push latches to reveal a satin interior to match the exterior casing. The Hanbury would make a statement on its own or as a duo in sitting room, dining room or bedroom alcoves offering refined storage in a wide range of beautiful, tinted wood and lacquer options and sizes.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Hanbury_Sideboard_TwoDoor_SycamoreSlate_SycamoreGrey_DAVIDSONLondon.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 37}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 5}]}
