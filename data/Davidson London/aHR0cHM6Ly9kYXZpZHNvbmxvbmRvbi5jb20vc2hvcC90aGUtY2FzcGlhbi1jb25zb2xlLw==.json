A simple statement of what can be achieved by perfect proportion, clean lines and a juxtaposition of curves and angles, available in any of Davidson's luxury timber and lacquer finishes. Inject a dose of glamour by a shimmering shade of gold leaf to the inner pedestal in white gold, moon gold or yellow gold options. The Caspian has a wide curve and a sharp, angular base combine to create a slick-looking structure that is available in range of sizes, an essential to any dining, living room or bedroom furniture collection.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Caspian_Console_SycamoreBlack_DAVIDSONLondon.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 56}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 10}]}
