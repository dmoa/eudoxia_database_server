{"name": "The Belmont Console", "price": "None", "currency": "None", "width": "140", "height": "84", "depth": "40", "dimension_unit": "cm", "description": "In the Belmont, DAVIDSON has brought a contemporary slant to a classic design with an edgy asymmetry that offers grace alongside its cool playfulness. The exterior of the table can be finished in any of DAVIDSON's luxury finishes, while the inside of the pedestal can be left as a veneer to match the rest of the console, or in a contrasting veneer for a dramatic effect. The Belmont console has been designed with a unique sculptural pedestal that differs from the rest of the collection in that it is unevenly wide all the way round and slanted to give it a modern, asymmetrical feel. Ultra-modern yet timelessly beautiful, this is the most sought after console from the collection owing to its iconic silhouette.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Belmont_Console_SycamoreBlack_WhiteGoldLeaf_DAVIDSONLondon.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 56}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 17}]}
