A luxury occasional, desk or dining chair, whose shimmering profile captivates in its originality. Finished in a dark-tinted beech, the legs both complement and contrast with the lustrous body in fabric from Armani Casa. The wing-shaped backrest, alongside the crisp lines of the armrests, create a silhouette that is as inviting as it is impressive. As with other DAVIDSON chairs, the Brunswick can be upholstered in a range of fabrics or leathers to suit your interior.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Brunswick_Chair_Armchair_DAVIDSONLondon.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 14}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 13}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 10}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 10}]}
