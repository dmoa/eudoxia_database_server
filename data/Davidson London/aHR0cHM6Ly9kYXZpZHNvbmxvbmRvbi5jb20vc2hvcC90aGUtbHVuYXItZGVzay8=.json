Whether for a private study space at home or an office boardroom, DAVIDSON's Lunar desk creates a true style statement while remaining functional and versatile. Taking its cues from the iconic Art Deco period of the 1930s, the Lunar Desk exhibits clean and minimal lines combined with an attitude of confidence, luxury, and grace, feeling both contemporary and classic simultaneously. Position in the middle of the room for full effect, where its glossy curves and sleek angles can be admired from all angles. As with all DAVIDSON designs, the desk is available in any of our range of luxury finishes. The Davidson team are on hand to discuss options to help decide which finish would be most fitting. The Lunar has been designed with discreet cable management to keep wires out of site and maintain its slick tidy aesthetic. Three drawers on each pedestal open by means of a smart leather-wrapped brass handle to a satin interior.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lunar_Desk_FiguredBlueEucalyptus_DAVIDSONLondon.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 11}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 11}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 23}]}
