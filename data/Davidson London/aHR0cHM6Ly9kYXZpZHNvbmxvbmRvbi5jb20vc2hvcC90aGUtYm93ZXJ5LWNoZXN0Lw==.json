Neatly house all your clutter in a drawer, while an open compartment provides additional storage, as well as attracting the eye. Choose to stack magazines or books here, either horizontally or vertically. Antiqued, brushed brass moulding creates an aesthetically satisfying framing to the open compartment and drawer. Its gentle metallic glint also offers just a hint of old-school glamour, contrasting with the more organic nature of the wood. As with all DAVIDSON designs, the table is available in a finish of your choice, including the moulding, allowing the Bowery to be adapted to best suit the mood of your room.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bowery_BedsideChest_SycamoreDusk_DAVIDSONLondon.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 17}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 28}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 10}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 4}]}
