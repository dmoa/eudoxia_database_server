{"name": "The Hartley Chair", "price": "None", "currency": "None", "width": "59", "height": "100", "depth": "64", "dimension_unit": "cm", "description": "The poise and refined allure of the Hartley makes it the perfect complement to an elegant dining set-up and gives new meaning to the term 'fine dining'. The dark-tinted beech finish of the Hartley's tapered legs creates a pleasing contrast with the paler tones of the upholstery. The gently curved seat meets the crisp lines of the backrest, creating a form that is the ideal balance of soft and smart. We offer the option of the Hartley with deep buttoning, for a classic look, or without, for something sleeker and more streamlined. As with the other chairs from the DAVIDSON collection the Hartley can be upholstered in a fabric or leather of your choice to suit any interior.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Hartley_Chair_Buttoned_Side2_DAVIDSONLondon.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 15}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 11}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 11}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 12}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 12}]}
