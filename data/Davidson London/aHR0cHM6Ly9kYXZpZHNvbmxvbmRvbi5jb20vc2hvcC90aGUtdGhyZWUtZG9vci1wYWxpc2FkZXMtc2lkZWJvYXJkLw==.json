Initially designed in a beautiful shade of blue bird's eye maple, as part of our West Coast Collection the cabinet offers a stylish and feminine look with a luxurious antiqued brushed brass base and trim. The Palisades cabinet is now available and would look beautiful in any of Davidson's signature timbers with nickel and brushed / polished trim options. The Davidson team can advise further regarding bespoke finishes. With its doors on push catches that sit elegantly flush, the cabinet opens to reveal a satin interior to match the outside casing with adjustable shelves.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Palisades_Sideboard_ThreeDoor_BlueBirdsEyeMaple_AntiquedBrass_DAVIDSONLondon.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 38}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 15}]}
