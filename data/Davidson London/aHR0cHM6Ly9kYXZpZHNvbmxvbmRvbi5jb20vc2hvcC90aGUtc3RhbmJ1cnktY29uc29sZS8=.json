The Stanbury console has a rectangular top standing on two shaped legs that meet in the centre, where they are united by a luxurious metal collar, in options of nickel, brass or antiqued brass, that stand on an elegant facetted base. The juxtaposition of the rectilinear lines and the sweeping curves draws the eye both along the table and down to the base, where the glint of the metal collar completes the look.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Stanbury_Console_SycamoreBlack_BrusehedBrass_DAVIDSONLondon.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 10}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 14}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 12}]}
