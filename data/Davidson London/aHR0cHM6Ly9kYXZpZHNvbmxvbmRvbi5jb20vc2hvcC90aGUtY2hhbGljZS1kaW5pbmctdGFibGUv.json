The visual opulence, together with its prestigious materials, would make The Chalice Table the crowning glory of any grand entrance hall or great room or small dining room, defining contemporary elegance at its best. Attention to detail is at the heart of this design. The stylishly slanted chalice table top can be finished in any of DAVIDSON's glamorous finishes and smart metal trim that sits flush to the frieze for a finishing touch of luxuriousness. Glistening highlights of liquid bronze are brushed into an open grain textured oak adding an enchanting effect to the elegant decanter shaped base. The overall effect is masterfully juxtaposed against the smooth dark satin top.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Chalice_DiningTable_DarkTintedOak_LiquidBronzeGilding_FrontView_DAVIDSONLondon.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 10}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 20}]}
