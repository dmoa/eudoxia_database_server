The large 2000-diameter top features a striking radial pattern made up of 16 veneer segments which have been skilfully placed to form the pattern. The dark tinted oak has been quarter sawn to create an amazing decorative grain pattern. The dramatic flecks and rays give the table a unique and striking look. The chamfered frieze features a brushed brass detail which adds an elegant touch to an already opulent table. The decanter-shaped base has been finished in our special incised bronze finish. This contemporary bronze finish has been highly distressed and finished in fine bronze powder and gives off a luxurious, maximalist impression to any piece.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GrandChalice_DiningTable_DarkTintedOak_Bronze_DAVIDSONLondon.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 10}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 18}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 11}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 15}]}
