Here, the finishes steal the show with its subtle but stunning natural sycamore ripple. A perfect complement to the Warwick coffee table is the lustrous, polished nickel trim, whose sleek gleam calls attention to the exquisite wood surface. Also available in any of Davidson's luxurious collection of pale, mid-tone and dark timbers and lacquers in glossy and satin options. The table comes in two standard small and large sizes, as well as custom sizes being available upon request. The hardwood edging provides extra protection promoting the quality and longevity of the design whilst the 10mm polished nickel moulding along the lower edge and base are the final details that enhance the Warwick's true style stature.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Warwick_CoffeeTable_SycamoreBlack_PolishedNickel_DAVIDSONLondon.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 38}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 12}]}
