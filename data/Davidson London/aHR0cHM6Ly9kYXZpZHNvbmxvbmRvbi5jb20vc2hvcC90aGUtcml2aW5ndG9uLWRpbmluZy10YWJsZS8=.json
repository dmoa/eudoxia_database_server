{"name": "The Rivington Dining Table", "price": "None", "currency": "\nÂ£", "width": "300", "height": "75", "depth": "130", "dimension_unit": "cm", "description": "The stylish Rivington dining table boasts contemporary edge and sophistication with its asymmetric pedestals offering a sculptural look in an iconic black-white pairing. The table top is finished in a pale satin sycamore silk top with three bases in high gloss sycamore black offering a modern contrast of colour and texture offset by antiqued brushed brass metalwork. Inspiration from the Rivington dining table comes from the two-tone tradition of contemporary artists, notably Mies Van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion. Combining two powerful shades in this boldly binary way expresses a confident minimalism and ultra-modern character. This table is available in a range of sizes to seat any number of people as well as bespoke finishes to suit each individual luxury dining room.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Rivington_DiningTable_SycamoreBlack_SycamoreSilk_AntiquedBrushedBrass_DAVIDSONLondon.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 13}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 15}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 21}]}
