Available in any of DAVIDSONs luxury timber finishes, the veneer has been beautifully laid by our skilled craftsmen in a radial pattern that forms a perfect point where all the hand-cut segments meet in the centre. The circular tabletop sits on a smooth and elegant hexagonal base boasting a beautiful range of straight lines and curves with a smart trim that sits flush to the frieze. The trim is available in nickel, brass, and antiqued brass options to give the table a contemporary edge. The Chatsworth tabletop can be downsized to be used as smart central table, perfect for a reception room, hallway, or luxury hotel lobby.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Chatsworth_DiningTable_DarkTintedOak_DAVIDSONLondon.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 13}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 22}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 7}]}
