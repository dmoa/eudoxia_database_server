The cabinet is a turn towards 1970s American arts and is celebration of innovative materials, distinct shapes, and explosive colours. With its doors on push catches that sit elegantly flush, the cabinet opens to reveal a satin interior to match the outside casing with adjustable shelves. The Two Door Palisades cabinet would work perfectly in an entrance hallway to make an impressive and stylish first impression or alternatively in a contemporary living room striking a beautiful balance between sophistication and functionality.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Palisades_Sideboard_TwoDoor_DarkTintedWalnut_PolishedBrass_DAVIDSONLondon.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 42}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 16}]}
