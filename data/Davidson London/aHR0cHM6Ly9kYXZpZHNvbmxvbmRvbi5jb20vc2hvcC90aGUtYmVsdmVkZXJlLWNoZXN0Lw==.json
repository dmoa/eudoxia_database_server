Graceful and charming, it works its magic effortlessly. Macassar ebony is an exotic black hardwood with reddish-brown highlights, that inject dark, rich tones into a room while its natural stripy grain adds a touch of the organic. Polished nickel detailing in the form of the handle and a slick recessed plinth contrast beautifully with the dark wood, adding just a hint of modern metallic pizzazz. Also available in nickel, brass or antiqued brass in a polished or brushed finish.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Belvedere_BedsideChest_DarkTintedMacassarEbony_PolishedBrass_DAVIDSONLondon.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 30}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 14}]}
