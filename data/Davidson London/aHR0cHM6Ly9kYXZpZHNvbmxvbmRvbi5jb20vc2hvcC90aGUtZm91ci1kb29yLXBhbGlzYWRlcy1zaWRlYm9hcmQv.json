The cabinet is a turn towards 1970s American arts and is celebration of innovative materials, distinct shapes, and explosive colours. With its doors on push catches that sit elegantly flush, the cabinet opens to reveal a satin interior to match the outside casing with adjustable shelves.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Palisades_Sideboard_FourDoor_SycamoreBlack_PolishedBrass_DAVIDSONLondon.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 34}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 15}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 15}]}
