The table boasts a circular top, with a striking radial pattern that sits on three gently curved legs, which stand on a smooth, facetted base in typical Art Deco style, an expression of robust beauty and effortless grace. There is a central disc where the legs join, and four feet finished in high-gloss black lacquer complete the look. If preferred, the central disc and feet can be finished to match the primary finish.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Hester_OccasionalTable_SycamoreBlack_PolishedNickel_DAVIDSONLondon.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 16}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 11}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 12}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 12}]}
