{"name": "The Dahlia Chest", "price": "None", "currency": "None", "width": "55", "height": "60", "depth": "50", "dimension_unit": "cm", "description": "Nothing quite completes a bedroom arrangement like a pair of elegant bedside tables. Providing the perfect framing for the bed centrepiece, a pair of Dahlia Bedside Tables can bring unity and harmony to your room scheme, not to mention offering practical storage space. While the Dahlia has been designed as a bedside table, there is no reason why it could not serve equally well as a small side table in a living space or study. A refined elegance born of restraint is evident in the design of the Dahlia, with its pristine box form and rectangular. Such a shape is satisfyingly robust and, despite its uncomplex geometry, creates serious impact. A single cabinet with a push-latch door provides versatile storage for bedroom essentials; the perfect space to hide away clutter, such as phone chargers and magazines. All DAVIDSON designs are available in a finish of your choosing. Our  team would be delighted to discuss options and help you to decide which of our finishes would suit your look.", "image_url": "https://davidsonlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Dahlia_BedsideChest_SycamoreDusk_PolishedBrass_DAVIDSONLondon.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 11}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 10}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 10}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 5}]}
