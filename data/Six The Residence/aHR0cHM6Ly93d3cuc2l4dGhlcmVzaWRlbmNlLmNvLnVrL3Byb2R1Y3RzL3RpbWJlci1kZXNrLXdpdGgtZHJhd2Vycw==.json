Sleek, sustainable, and architectural, the desk is both stylish and practical. The desk features floating drawers suspended by brass effect cylinders, and the drawers can be attached on either the left or right-hand side of the desk to suit your room layout. Designed to look like four sleek drawers furnished with four powder-coated metal knobs, the floating drawers are in fact two deep drawers, ideal for modern storage needs. To ensure a clutter-free desk, additional storage is discreetly disguised in the integrated drawer in the top of the desk. The desk sits on slim tapered legs and is slightly rounded at the edges giving a mid-century feel to the piece. Manufactured from sustainable FSC certified ash wood and stained walnut, the desk has been created to keep up with the demands of homeworking. The desk is deep enough to comfortably fit a laptop, screen, lamp, and papers. A natural complement to any of our seating options. Also available in Black.", "image_url": "https://www.sixtheresidence.co.uk/cdn/shop/products/DeskCloseUp.jpg?v=1678366952&width=320", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
