{"name": "Grassetto Vine Cushion Cover - Green", "price": "80", "currency": "£", "width": "51", "height": "51", "depth": "None", "dimension_unit": "cm", "description": "The bold textiles in our Grassetto range focus on craftsmanship and pattern; the handwoven fabric used for the Grassetto Vine Cushion Cover is made from natural tussar silk, cultivated in Indian states that have been producing the yarn for centuries. The yarn is spun, dyed and block-printed – all by hand – with a curling vine pattern in muted green tones on one side and a spotted design on the reverse. Due to the nature of the fabric and the artisanal processes that shape these cushion covers, there may be some colour and pattern variation between each piece – it's all part of their charm.", "image_url": "https://www.oka.com/media/catalog/product/g/r/grassetto-vine-cushion-cover-green-a18652-1-34-1006-37-01.png?width=585&height=658&canvas=585,658&quality=80&fit=bounds", "product_code": "A18652-1-34-1006-37", "extension": "png", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 11}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 16}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 18}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 2}]}
