{"name": "Sufian Rug - Ivory", "price": "2295", "currency": "Â£", "width": "244", "height": "None", "depth": "305", "dimension_unit": "cm", "description": "Our Sufian Rug has a very textural appearance with a tufted pattern that's formed from symmetrical knots often known as Persian knots. This is achieved by hand, with artisans tying the wefts (horizontal threads) around a single warp (vertical thread) and then repeating the process on the remaining warps as the artisans move across the rug. The asymmetric knot produces a design formed of curving lines, rather than completely straight, which helps to achieve the pattern. Before the process begins, the yarns are hand dyed and dried in the sun for their antique colour effect. Due to this artisanal process, each rug will have individual characteristics that add to its charm.", "image_url": "https://www.oka.com/media/catalog/product/s/u/sufian-rug-a19573-1-23-1144-147-01.png", "product_code": "A19573-1-23-1144-147", "extension": "png", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 19}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 14}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 3}]}
