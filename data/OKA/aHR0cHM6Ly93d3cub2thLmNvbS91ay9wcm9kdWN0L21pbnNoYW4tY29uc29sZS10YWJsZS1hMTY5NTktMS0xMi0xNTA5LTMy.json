Our console table has been so-named due to its bamboo-inspired frame with the turned struts sculpted to hold a delicate appearance with visible but smooth joins and topped with decorative finials. It's made from solid oak with a washed finish that the grain is visible through and features veneer shelves for displaying objects and books alike.", "image_url": "https://www.oka.com/media/catalog/product/b/a/bamboo-detail-shelved-console-A16959-1-12-1509-32-01.png?width=585&height=658&canvas=585,658&quality=80&fit=bounds", "product_code": "A16959-1-12-1509-32", "extension": "png", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 23}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 25}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 8}]}
