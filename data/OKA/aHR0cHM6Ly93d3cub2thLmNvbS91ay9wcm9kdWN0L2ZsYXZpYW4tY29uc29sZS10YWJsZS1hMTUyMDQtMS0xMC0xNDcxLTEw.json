{"name": "Flavian Console Table - Oak/Stone", "price": "997", "currency": "£", "width": "160", "height": "78", "depth": "44", "dimension_unit": "cm", "description": "This console is all about contrast; warm oak is offset by cool stone to create a two-tone effect. Constructed from traditional materials, with column-like legs, you can see why we named it after a Roman dynasty. With a narrow profile, it's ideal for a hallway or could even double up as a dressing table – it certainly has the surface space. Cut from a large piece of natural stone, the table's surface features meandering white veins that are formed from crystallised minerals within the rock. White markings also decorate its façade where it's been bleached by the sun, making each one utterly unique.", "image_url": "https://www.oka.com/media/catalog/product/f/l/flavian-console-table-a15204-1-10-1471-10-01.png", "product_code": "A15204-1-10-1471-10", "extension": "png", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 29}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 19}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 10}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 2}]}
