It's woven in a circular loom, then dyed to create the muted blue-green tones; these are not absorbed by the bamboo, which lends a characterful, mottled appearance. The throw is finished with a thick fringe of loop tassels, bordered by a woven trim.", "image_url": "https://www.oka.com/media/catalog/product/l/i/liena-throw-moss-a19544-1-10-1172-10-01.png", "product_code": "A19544-1-10-1172-10", "extension": "png", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 14}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 14}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 4}]}
