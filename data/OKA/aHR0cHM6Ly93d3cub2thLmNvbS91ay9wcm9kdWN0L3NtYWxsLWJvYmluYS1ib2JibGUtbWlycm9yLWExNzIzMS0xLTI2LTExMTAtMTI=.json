This style had legs that were generally lathe-turned into ornamental shapes in order to make a feature of them. Drawing on this characteristic, the frame of our Small Bobina Bobble Mirror is hand carved from mango wood into pleasing spherical shapes, which is then hand painted a neutral cream shade and finished with a high gloss which accentuates its form.", "image_url": "https://www.oka.com/media/catalog/product/b/o/bobina-bobble-mirror-flax-a17231-1-26-1110-12-01.png", "product_code": "A17231-1-26-1110-12", "extension": "png", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 10}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 19}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 17}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 2}]}
