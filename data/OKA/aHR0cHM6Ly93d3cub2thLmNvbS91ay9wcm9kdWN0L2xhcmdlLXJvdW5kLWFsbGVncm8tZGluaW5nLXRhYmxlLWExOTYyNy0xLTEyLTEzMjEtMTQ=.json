{"name": "Large Round Allegro Dining Table - Burnt Oak", "price": "3595", "currency": "Â£", "width": "165", "height": "77", "depth": "None", "dimension_unit": "cm", "description": "Our Allegro Dining Table features a base that flares upwards and outwards comparably to a gramophone, which lent it its musical name. This is the larger of our two round versions, though it is also available in three rectangular variations. Round tables create a more intimate experience while the linear version is more traditional. All the tops feature an indentation that frames the edge, drawing attention to the character in the textured grain of the oak. This version comes in a warm Burnt Oak, but it is also available in a paler Weathered Oak finish.", "image_url": "https://www.oka.com/media/catalog/product/l/a/large-round-allegro-dining-table-burnt-oak-a19627-1-12-1321-14-01.png", "product_code": "A19627-1-12-1321-14", "extension": "png", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 13}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 21}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 6}]}
