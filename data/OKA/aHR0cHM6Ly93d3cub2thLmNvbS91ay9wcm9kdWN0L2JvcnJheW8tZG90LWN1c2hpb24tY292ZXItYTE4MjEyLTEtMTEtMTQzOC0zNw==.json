Ikat is an ancient dyeing technique that originates in Indonesia requiring the skill of masterful artisans. We have digitally printed the pattern onto the linen so that all the character of the paintwork is portrayed, from the pattern itself to the soft painterly lines that blend from the blue into the white. Our range is named Borrayo for this very reason – a play on the Portuguese word for 'blur', which is a distinctive quality of Ikat designs.", "image_url": "https://www.oka.com/media/catalog/product/b/o/borrayo-dot-cushion-cover-dark-blue-red-a18212-1-11-1438-37-01.png", "product_code": "A18212-1-11-1438-37", "extension": "png", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 13}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 26}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 10}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 4}]}
