At OKA, we don't like things being too 'matchy matchy' as Co-Founder Sue Jones says, and so this distinctive piece, with its classic Belgian roll arms, wide and deep seat and curving back, sits perfectly as a standalone armchair, making a statement all on its own. Its legs are removable and will be attached upon delivery.", "image_url": "https://www.oka.com/media/catalog/product/a/u/audrick-armchair-a15554-2-11-1173-10-01.png", "product_code": "A15554-2-11-1173-10", "extension": "png", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 16}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 12}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 13}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 16}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 5}]}
