Specifically, the coffee table features a helix-shaped strut and striking column detailing, crafted from warm oak and cool stone. Cut from a larger piece of natural stone, the table's surface features meandering white veins that are formed from crystallised minerals within the rock. White markings also decorate its façade where it's been bleached by the sun, making each one utterly unique.", "image_url": "https://www.oka.com/media/catalog/product/f/l/flavian-coffee-table-A15342-1-12-1471-10-01.png?width=585&height=658&canvas=585,658&quality=80&fit=bounds", "product_code": "A15342-1-12-1471-10", "extension": "png", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 42}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 11}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 3}]}
