{"name": "Medanoso Rug - Chalk White", "price": "995", "currency": "Â£", "width": "238", "height": "None", "depth": "305", "dimension_unit": "cm", "description": "Handwoven in a complex process by skilled artisans on a vertical loom, the Medanoso shares its pattern with sand ripples, which is why we named it after two of the world's tallest dunes. Our original was sand coloured as well, but this version is a chalky colour which brings a sophisticated touch to interiors. The colour is achieved through an abrash finishing process attained through the dying of the yarn before it is woven, which results in a mottled effect that runs through the rug. This means that each piece will have its own individual characteristics.", "image_url": "https://www.oka.com/media/catalog/product/m/e/medanoso-rug-off-white-a15243-1-10-1066-10-01.png", "product_code": "A15243-1-10-1066-10", "extension": "png", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 19}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 10}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 9}]}
