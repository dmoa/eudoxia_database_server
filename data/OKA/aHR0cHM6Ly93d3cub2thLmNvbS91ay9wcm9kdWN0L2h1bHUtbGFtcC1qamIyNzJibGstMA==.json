Please note that each of these lamp bases are hand glazed and fired and as a result the colours and glaze will vary. Its pleasing silhouette, combined with an acrylic stand, looks at home on a console table or sideboard. Pair with a plain or patterned lampshade, as you prefer, but we recommend a 40-50cm diameter shade with this design.", "image_url": "https://www.oka.com/media/catalog/product/a/1/a10330-3-14-1125-10.png", "product_code": "JJB272BLK-0", "extension": "png", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 10}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 15}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 11}]}
