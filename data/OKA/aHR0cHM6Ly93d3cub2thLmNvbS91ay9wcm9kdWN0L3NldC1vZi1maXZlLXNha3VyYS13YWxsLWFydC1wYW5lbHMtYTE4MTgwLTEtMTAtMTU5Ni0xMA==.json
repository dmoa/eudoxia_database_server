These five handmade panels display traditional paintings of flowers and birds in a quietly elegant style. The designs are hand painted onto ochre-stained glass, which then casts shadows on the wall for a 3D effect when the light shines through them. Each piece will have individual characteristics due to the artisanal process.", "image_url": "https://www.oka.com/media/catalog/product/s/e/set-of-five-sakura-wall-art-panels-distressed-ochre-a18180-1-10-1596-10-01.png", "product_code": "A18180-1-10-1596-10", "extension": "png", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 16}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 10}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 16}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 10}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 1}]}
