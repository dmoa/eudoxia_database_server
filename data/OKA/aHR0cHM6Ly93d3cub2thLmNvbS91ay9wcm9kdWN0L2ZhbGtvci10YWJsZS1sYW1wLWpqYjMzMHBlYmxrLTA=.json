{"name": "Falkor Glass Table Lamp - Black", "price": "145", "currency": "Â£", "width": "17", "height": "35", "depth": "17", "dimension_unit": "cm", "description": "Made by highly skilled glassworkers, this incredibly textured spotted table lamp takes statement lighting to a new level. To make the Falkor, a layer of black glaze is applied over a layer of white. The top layer is then carefully pared back until only a few black circles remain. This complex process likens the lamp to a dragon's egg, which is why we named it after a famous fictional mythical creature. Polka dots have such a timeless feel about them and we love the textured surface of this lamp.", "image_url": "https://www.oka.com/media/catalog/product/a/1/a10703-3-13-1039-10_01_1.png?width=585&height=658&canvas=585,658&quality=80&fit=bounds", "product_code": "JJB330PEBLK-0", "extension": "png", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 10}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 18}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 10}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 26}]}
