{"name": "OKA X Cabana Arabesque Lampshade 45cm - Paprika Red/Moss Green", "price": "450", "currency": "Â£", "width": "45", "height": "31", "depth": "None", "dimension_unit": "cm", "description": "The OKA X Cabana lighting collection is a collaboration between Cabana Magazine Founder Martina Mondadori and OKA Co-Founder Sue Jones. The design of the Arabesque is a lovely fusion of the pair's design ethos: it's design first came to life when Sue found a beautiful piece of fabric in a market in India, Martina then reimagined the pattern incorporating Moroccan influences. Crafted by skilled artisans in Delhi, the pattern is traced onto the finest tussar silk, which is then intricately hand embroidered with cotton and lined before being gathered on a metal frame. The embroidery style is a herringbone stitch based upon traditional phulkari embroidery, which is a style that originates from Punjab and dates back to the 15th century. It takes three to four craftspeople up to 12 days to create each one; due to this handmaking process, each one will be utterly unique. The shade is available in two colourways and two sizes, this orangey red and green lampshade is the larger version.", "image_url": "https://www.oka.com/media/catalog/product/c/a/cabana-oka-arabesque-lampshade-45cm-moss-paprika-a18850-2-34-1581-81-02.png", "product_code": "A18850-2-34-1581-81", "extension": "png", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 4}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 16}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 25}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 15}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 3}]}
