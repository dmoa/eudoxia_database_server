The handwoven fabric is made from natural tussar silk, cultivated in the Indian states that have been producing the yarn for centuries. The yarn is then hand spun, hand dyed, and hand block printed with a houndstooth pattern on one side, and a small square pattern on the reverse. This iteration, in the Grey print, can blend seamlessly into a variety of cushion collections, thanks to its neutral backdrop.", "image_url": "https://www.oka.com/media/catalog/product/g/r/grassetto-houndstooth-cushion_cover-grey-a19195-1-34-1125-37-01.png", "product_code": "A19195-1-34-1125-37", "extension": "png", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 8}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 17}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 12}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 11}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 11}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 6}]}
