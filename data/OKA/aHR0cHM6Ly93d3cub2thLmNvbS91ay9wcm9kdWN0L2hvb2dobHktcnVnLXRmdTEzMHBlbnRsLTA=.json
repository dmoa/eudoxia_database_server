{"name": "Hooghly Jute Soumak Rug - Ecru/Charcoal", "price": "1117", "currency": "Â£", "width": "240", "height": "None", "depth": "305", "dimension_unit": "cm", "description": "A muted colour palette prevents this hardwearing jute rug from feeling overbearing. Adorned with geometric shapes, including diamonds and criss-crosses, it's ideal for a modern scheme. Place in a hallway, bedroom or wherever you like. Soumak Rugs (also known as tapestry weaves), like the Hooghly, are purposefully pile-less. They are woven incredibly tightly, which gives them a coarse feel and allows any subtle decoration to take centre stage. Highly textured, this technique is what gives the Hooghly its unique, beautifully rustic appearance.", "image_url": "https://www.oka.com/media/catalog/product/h/o/hooghly-rug-tfu130pentl-0-01.png", "product_code": "TFU130PENTL-0", "extension": "png", "styles": [{"style_name": ".CONTEMPORARY", "weight": 6}, {"style_name": ".MINIMALISM", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".MID_CENTURY_MODERN", "weight": 3}, {"style_name": ".COUNTRY", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".COSTAL", "weight": 16}, {"style_name": ".RUSTIC", "weight": 16}, {"style_name": ".ART_DECO", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".INDUSTRIAL", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".SHABBY_CHIC", "weight": 1}, {"style_name": ".CLASSICAL_SLASH_TRADITIONAL", "weight": 7}, {"style_name": ".BOHEMIAN", "weight": 16}, {"style_name": ".ELECTRIC_SLASH_RETRO", "weight": 0}, {"style_name": ".TRANSITIONAL", "weight": 9}, {"style_name": ".CHALET", "weight": 5}, {"style_name": ".FRENCH_CLASSICAL", "weight": 2}, {"style_name": ".SCANDINAVIAN", "weight": 2}]}
