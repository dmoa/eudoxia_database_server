The ethereal geometric and sculptural base is made entirely from bronze-patina brass. This piece is designed by Kifu Augousti, the daughter of Ria and Yiouri Augousti. Part of the Apoli Capsule Series. Handmade; Wipe clean with soft dry cloth; Made in Philippines. Although inspired by her parents, her collection of Home Accessories and Furniture is a distinct identity of its own. Kifu uses handmade techniques of elaborate inlay patterns of shagreen, shells, semi-precious stones, materials she experienced as a child growing up in her parent's studio, but interpreted in a younger quirkier way reflecting her youth. From her 'jewelry inspired knobs' on decorative boxes, gold bar boxes and an extravagant inlay pattern mix of shagreen and shell inspired by galactic constellations, as seen on her enormous round mirror, is refreshing to see. Kifu embodies whimsical elements throughout her collection and is not afraid to be daring and unexpected in her approach to design. All shagreen-covered items should be kept out of direct sunlight, color variants may occur on the stingray and other exotic finishes, but this showcases the Parisian label's commitment to creating authentic luxurious products using natural components.", "image_url": "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a010700d0e6287d9d4fca2f/1634747388298-UH5D9N4T9Y8DF00VGJYW/KL11-BRG-V1.jpg?format=500w", "product_code": "KL11-BR01/BRG", "extension": "jpeg"}
