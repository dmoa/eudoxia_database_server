The cream shagreen inlaid top sits on clusters of bronze-patina brass legs that are conceptually inspired by bird feathers floating on top of a lake. The border of the top is accentuated by a subtle and elegant bronze-patina brass indentation detail. Add the larger size and this becomes a stunning nesting set. This piece is designed by Kifu Augousti the daughter of Ria and Yiouri Augousti. Available in other finishes.
