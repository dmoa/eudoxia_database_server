The cream shagreen inlaid top sits on clusters of bronze-patina brass legs that are conceptually inspired by bird feathers floating on top of a lake. The border of the top is accentuated by a subtle and elegant bronze-patina brass indentation detail. Designed by Kifu Augousti, this piece can be purchased as part of a nesting set. It is available in various finishes and is handmade in the Philippines.", "image_url": "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a010700d0e6287d9d4fca2f/1649255155383-I7ZSP8OYCW8CXGZMM1PA/KST44-D1-V1.jpg?format=500w", "product_code": "KST44", "extension": "jpeg"}
