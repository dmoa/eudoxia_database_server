The cream shagreen inlaid top sits on clusters of bronze-patina brass legs that are conceptually inspired by bird feathers floating on top of a lake. The border of the top is accentuated by a subtle and elegant bronze-patina brass indentation detail. Add the larger size and this becomes a stunning nesting set. This piece is designed by Kifu Augousti the daughter of Ria and Yiouri Augousti. Available in other finishes. Can be purchased as a nesting set, see other listings.", "image_url": "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a010700d0e6287d9d4fca2f/1649254159543-8IPUDMRFYFSRGRSCSTLB/KST43-D1-V1.jpg?format=500w", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
