The stunning semi-precious Tiger Eye Blue top sits on a pair of geometric and sculptural bronze-patina brass bases. This piece is designed by Kifu Augousti the daughter of Ria and Yiouri Augousti. Part of the Apoli Capsule Series, see images of collection at end of slide.The dimensions of this piece are 118.11 x 43.31 x 29.53 inchesAll Kifu Paris pieces are handmade by artisans, ultimately making each piece unique.Custom color/sizing is available on request.Wipe clean with a soft dry cloth.Although inspired by her parents, her collection of Home Accessories and Furniture is a distinct identity of its own. Kifu uses handmade techniques of elaborate inlay patterns of shagreen, shells, semi-precious stones, materials she experienced as a child growing up in her parent's studio, but interpreted in a younger quirkier way reflecting her youth. From her \"jewelry inspired knobs\" on decorative boxes, gold bar boxes and an extravagant inlay pattern mix of shagreen and shell inspired by galactic constellations, as seen on her enormous round mirror, is refreshing to see. Kifu embodies whimsical elements throughout her collection and is not afraid to be daring and unexpected in her approach to design.All shagreen-covered items should be kept out of direct sunlight, and color variants may occur on the stingray and other exotic finishes, but this showcases the Parisian label's commitment to creating authentic luxurious products using natural components.", "image_url": "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a010700d0e6287d9d4fca2f/1680874482431-TR303YRJQGYYN45CEHY6/KDT02-BRGLT-BRGDRK-D1-1.jpg?format=500w", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
