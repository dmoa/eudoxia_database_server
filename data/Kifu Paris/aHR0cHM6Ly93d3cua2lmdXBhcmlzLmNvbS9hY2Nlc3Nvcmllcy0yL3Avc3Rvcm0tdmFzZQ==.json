Available in either black pen shell or antique natural shagreen. Paris - 1 unit in stock in Grey Blue Shagreen. Handmade. Shagreen & Pen Shell, bronze-patina brass. All interior of KIFU PARIS vases can support water. Wipe clean with soft dry cloth. Made in Philippines. Although inspired by her parents, her collection of Home Accessories and Furniture is a distinct identity of its own. Kifu uses handmade techniques of elaborate inlay patterns of shagreen, shells, semi-precious stones, materials she experienced as a child growing up in her parent's studio, but interpreted in a younger quirkier way reflecting her youth. From her 'jewelry inspired knobs' on decorative boxes, gold bar boxes and an extravagant inlay pattern mix of shagreen and shell inspired by galactic constellations, as seen on her enormous round mirror, is refreshing to see. Kifu embodies whimsical elements throughout her collection and is not afraid to be daring and unexpected in her approach to design.", "image_url": "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a010700d0e6287d9d4fca2f/1513832166537-C7J4XFTBH1FNQTJQ52OD/KV02-D1-%26-KV02-L9.jpg", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
