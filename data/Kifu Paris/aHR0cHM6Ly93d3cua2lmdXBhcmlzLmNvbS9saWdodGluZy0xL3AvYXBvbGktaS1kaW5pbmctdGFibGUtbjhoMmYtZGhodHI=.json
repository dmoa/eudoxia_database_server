The chiseled legs, which are an iconic shape within the KIFU PARIS universe, morph into the solid shades that create a modern-vintage feel. This piece is designed by Kifu Augousti, the daughter of Ria and Yiouri Augousti. All shagreen pieces are hand-dyed by artisans. Available as a floor lamp. Custom color/sizing is available on request. Made to order 8-10 weeks. Wipe clean with a soft dry cloth. Inspired by her parents, Kifu’s collection has its own distinct identity, using handmade techniques with shagreen, shells, semi-precious stones, reflecting her youthful, quirky style.", "image_url": "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a010700d0e6287d9d4fca2f/1704848189973-XGHHFD5X2VI0DLAVE0MR/Chital+III+table+lamp+1.jpg?format=500w", "product_code": "None", "extension": "jpeg"}
