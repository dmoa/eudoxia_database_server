Some splitting of the wood in this product may occur as part of the continual drying process. The degree to which splitting may occur will depend on seasonal and environmental factors. This is normal, expected, and common for complex solid wood products of this nature as the wood continues to dry and age.", "image_url": "https://cdn1.christopherguy.com/images/front/800px/76-0449_1344.png", "product_code": "76-0449", "extension": "png"}
