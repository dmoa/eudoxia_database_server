{"name": "Lars Side Table", "price": "5695", "currency": "S$", "width": "50", "height": "63", "depth": "50", "dimension_unit": "cm", "description": "Inspired by classic Scandinavian Modernist designs, Lars is a supremely elegant side table. The brass base is in a 60s tripod spindle style and is perfectly complemented by the clear tempered glass top. A true modern classic. Base: Coated solid brass. Small imperfections such as pinholes and indentations may be present due to the handcrafting; they add unique charm and should not be considered defects. Over time, antique brass develops a patina, enhancing its beauty.", "image_url": "https://cdn1.christopherguy.com/images/front/800px/76-0557_.png", "product_code": "76-0557", "extension": "png"}
